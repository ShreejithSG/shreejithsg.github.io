## **Open-Source Research Engineer – Diffusion Systems**  
**FastVideo / Hao AI Lab, UC San Diego** – California, US  
*Oct. 2025 – Present*  
- Leading open-source contributor to **FastVideo** (3K+ GitHub stars), unifying 10B+ parameter video diffusion models with distributed training/inference infrastructure supporting **multi-node H100 clusters**.  
- Designed and implemented novel **LoRA extraction pipeline** for 5B-parameter T2V diffusion checkpoints, enabling modular weight decomposition and **60%+ memory reduction** while preserving generation quality.  
- Ported and optimized **MatrixGame-2 (world model)** inference through hybrid attention refactoring (FlashAttention, sparse patterns, tiled computation), achieving **2.5x faster generation** on H100 clusters.  
- Collaborating on research exploration for **diffusion language models (dLLM)**, investigating architectural optimizations (KV-caching, sparse attention, semi-autoregressive mechanisms) for efficient text generation.
