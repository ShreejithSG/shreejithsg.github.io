Greetings! I am a **Master’s student in Data Science at UC San Diego** and an aspiring **Machine Learning Research Engineer**. My passion lies in building **efficient, scalable, and high-performance AI systems**, with a focus on **large-scale training, generative AI, and distributed inference**.

I currently hold multiple roles that reflect this technical depth:

- 🚀 **Open-Source Research Engineer, FastVideo** — Leading contributions to a **distributed video diffusion training library** (3K+ stars), optimizing **multi-node H100 clusters** and implementing novel **LoRA extraction pipelines** for 5B+ parameter models.
- 🤖 **GenAI Specialist, Scale AI** — Collaborating with the research division to design **chain-of-thought evaluation frameworks** and analyze **RLHF trajectories** for frontier reasoning models.
- 🌎 **Graduate Researcher, Climate Analytics Lab (UCSD)** — Developing **interpretable machine learning pipelines** (PySR, SINDy) to uncover physical relationships in climate data.
