Greetings! As a **Master's student at UC San Diego** studying data science, I have a strong interest in using **AI and data** to tackle challenging real-world issues. I want to help advance cutting-edge AI-driven solutions with an emphasis on creativity and useful applications.

I work as an **AI Specialist at UC San Diego Business & Financial Services (BFS)** right now, where I employ GenAI products like TritonGPT to increase data accessibility, user experiences, and workflow efficiency. My interest in AI-driven automation and optimization has grown as a result of this work, and I'm always looking for new methods to use AI to solve challenging issues and enhance internal systems.

I'm actively looking for possibilities to work in a **research lab** where I can use my background in academia and real-world experience to investigate cutting-edge data science, AI, and machine learning methods in practical settings. I am excited to make a significant contribution to AI and machine learning research, especially in fields like optimization, computer vision, and natural language processing.

I'm also searching for **summer internships** in the fields of **data science and AI/ML**. I want to help with industry-driven projects, learn new things, and collaborate with professionals to use AI and machine learning technology to tackle important challenges.
