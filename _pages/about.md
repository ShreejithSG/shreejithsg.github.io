Greetings! I am a **Master’s student in Data Science at UC San Diego** passionate about building **interpretable, reliable, and impactful AI systems**. My work spans **machine learning, symbolic regression, and large-scale data engineering**, applied across both **scientific research** and **industry settings**.

I currently hold multiple roles that reflect this balance:

- 🌎 **Graduate Researcher, Climate Analytics Lab (UCSD)** — working with Prof. Duncan Watson-Parris on **interpretable machine learning for climate science**. I design symbolic regression pipelines (PySR, SINDy, KAN) to uncover physically meaningful relationships from satellite climate data, benchmarking against deep learning approaches and hybrid neural-symbolic architectures.  
- 🤖 **Specialist, Human Frontier Collective at Scale AI** — collaborating with the Scale AI research division to stress-test and refine **frontier generative AI systems**, contributing to model diagnostics, optimization, and responsible AI evaluation.  
- 🎓 **Teaching Assistant, UCSD (DSC200 – Data Science Programming)** — supporting instruction and mentoring graduate students in programming best practices, data structures, and applied problem-solving.

## Research & Publications
- **Accepted paper (2025):** *BirdCLEF Acoustic Biodiversity Challenge* — scalable one-vs-rest detection pipeline for avian bioacoustics (to appear in CLEF 2025 proceedings).  
- **Other publications:**  
  - *Leveraging Data Analytics in Azure for Effective Churn Management* (1st Author)  
  - *A Comprehensive Examination of Toxic Tweet Classification on Twitter* (1st Author)  
  - *Analysis of Traditional & Deep Learning Architectures in NLP*  
  - *Evolution of DDoS Detection: Traditional vs. Modern ML Models*
