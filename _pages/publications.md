## 1. Symbolic Regression for Aerosol–Cloud–Climate Interactions *(in progress)*  

Graduate Researcher, Advisor: Duncan Watson-Parris
Climate Analytics Lab, UC San Diego (2025 – Present)  

### **Description:**  
Researching interpretable machine learning for climate science:  

- Designed symbolic regression pipelines (**PySR, SINDy, KAN**) to extract physically meaningful mappings from satellite climate data.  
- Benchmarked symbolic vs. deep neural networks (**R² = 0.87 vs. 0.92**).  
- Built hybrid neural-to-symbolic architectures for **explainability without performance loss**.  
- Deployed scalable HPC workflows on SDSC clusters for training, sensitivity analysis, and interpretability mapping.

## 1. Toxic Tweet Classification on Twitter  

**S. S. Gokulnath**, S. Jayaraman and N. T, "A Comprehensive Examination of Toxic Tweet Classification on Twitter," 2024 Ninth International Conference on Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (ICONSTEM), Chennai, India, 2024, pp. 1-5, doi: 10.1109/ICONSTEM60960.2024.10568694 

## **Description:**   
This study explores advanced **NLP techniques** to detect and classify **toxic tweets** on Twitter. We evaluated both **traditional machine learning models** and **transformer-based architectures** for identifying toxicity levels in user-generated content. Our experiments highlighted the robustness of **transformers like BERT** in handling the nuances of toxic language.
